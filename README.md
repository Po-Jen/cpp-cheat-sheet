# C++ Cheat Sheet

These are two cheat sheets I put together describing both basic C++ syntax and many data structures and algorithms in C++ for my past interviews at Google.

## [C++ Syntax Cheat Sheet](C++ Syntax.md)
## [Data Structures and Algorithms Cheat Sheet](Data Structures and Algorithms.md)
## [A Neat Cheat Sheet](http://upload.cppreference.com/mwiki/images/e/e7/container-library-overview-2012-12-27.pdf)
